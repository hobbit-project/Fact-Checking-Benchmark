# Factcheck Benchmark

[FactCheck](https://github.com/dice-group/FactCheck) is an algorithm that uses evidences found on the web to confirm or deny a particular query. [FactBench](https://github.com/SmartDataAnalytics/FactBench) is a collection of RDF models that are bounded by time spans and are group in train and test sets. This repository implements the components required by [Hobbit](https://github.com/hobbit-project) benchmarking platform to facilitate the evaluation of FactCheck using the models provided by FactBench.

## Running the Benchmark 
1) Follow the steps outlined for setting up the SDK [benchmark environment](https://github.com/hobbit-project/java-sdk-example#before-you-start).
2) Clone the the FactBench repository and copy the [test](https://github.com/SmartDataAnalytics/FactBench/tree/master/test) and [train](https://github.com/SmartDataAnalytics/FactBench/tree/master/train) directories to the `data\factbench\` directory.
3) Update the [factchenckbenchmark.ini](https://github.com/oshando/factcheck-benchmark/blob/master/src/main/resources/factcheckBenchmark.ini) file with the full path to the test and train directories that were copied in the previous step.

## Deploying the benchmark
1) Follow the [steps](https://github.com/hobbit-project/java-sdk-example#how-to-create-a-benchmark) to build the docker images that can be uploaded to the remote respositories. to create the benchmark Please find the basic benchmark component implementations in the [sources filder](https://github.com/hobbit-project/java-sdk-example/tree/master/src/main/java/org/hobbit/sdk/examples/examplebenchmark/benchmark). You may extend the components with logic of your benchmark and debug the components as pure java codes by running the `checkHealth()` method from [ExampleBenchmarkTest](https://github.com/hobbit-project/java-sdk-example/blob/master/src/test/java/org/hobbit/sdk/examples/ExampleBenchmarkTest.java)). You may specify input parameters models for benchmark and system you are running.
